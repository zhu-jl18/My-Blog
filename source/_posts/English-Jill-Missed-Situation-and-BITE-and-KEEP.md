### Ways to talk about a MISSED SITUATION

A **MISSED SITUATION** means that *you were going to do something, but something else happened and it stopped you doing what you wanted to do*. In Chinese it means "我本来想 但是". 



There are 5 expressions to describe it:

{% note warning %}

I was <u>going to</u> go shopping, <u>but</u> I got a phone call which lasted nearly an hour, and by the time the call ended the shops were are shut.

 **all set to, but**
I was <u>all set to</u> go on holiday, <u>but</u> then my car broke down , and i had to spend the money on repairs instead.

 **would have, but**
I <u>would have</u> called you yesterday, <u>but</u> my phone wasn't working.

**had every intention of, but**
I <u> had every intention of</u> returning the book to the library last week,  <u>but</u> I had a friend staying, and she had been reading it.

 **had it all arranged to, but**
I <u>had it all arranged to</u> give my friend a surprise party, <u>but</u> then she found out about my plan, and said she didn't want one!

### Expressions using BITE 

The literal meaning of "bite" is *to use your teeth to cut into something or someone*. In Chinese it means "咬". But there are lots of examples in which bite are used in particular ways to express metaphorical meanings, metaphors, idioms.



If you say something to somebody, and they just reply in an aggressive way, unpleasant, like: "What do you mean?" or "Oh, don't bother me now, I'm busy". That's called:
{% note warning %}
**bite sb's head off** 莫名其妙地对…发脾气

{% note warning %}
**bite one's tongue** 缄口不语

The next one is "bite the bullet". It describes the situation where you have to force yourself to do something unpleasant or difficult, or to be brave to face it. Breifly, I don't want to do, but I have to.
{% note warning %}
**bite the bullet** 咬紧牙关应付，硬着头皮应对
